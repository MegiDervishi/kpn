# Kahn Process Networks 

:fire: Implementations
- Sequential (sequential.ml)
- Pipes (unix_pipes.ml)
- Network with thread (network.ml)

:fire: Applications
- Mandelbrot (mandelbrot.ml) using the Sequential Kahn
- k_Means (k_means.ml) using the Pipes implementation
- Tic Tac Toe game (tictactoe.ml) using the network (sockets) with thread implementation

:fire: Compile
To compile all run `make`. 
To compile a particular application run: 
  * `make mandelbrot`
  * `make k_means`
  * `make tictactoe`
